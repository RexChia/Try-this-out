    You can begin using Git distributed version control before you write your first line of code with virtually no cost or risk. You get many benefits, including being able to revert to a known good state whenever you get in trouble. When you need to switch contexts, you can quickly create a private local branch. Later, you can either publish the branch or dispose of it.
    All this is done on your local dev machine, with no server required. When you’re ready, you can quickly share your code and begin collaborating in TFS or on a third-party Git service.
    You can use Visual Studio and Git to collaborate with your team using Team Foundation Server (on-premises or on Visual Studio Team Services), on CodePlex, or on a third-party service such as GitHub or Bitbucket.
